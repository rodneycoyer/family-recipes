*Ingredient List*

##### Borbar Condiments
- 12 oz crab meat or razor clams
- 2 scallions sliced
- 2 tbsp peanuts roasted, salted, and chopped.
- 2 tbsp coriander leaves
- 2 tbsp fried garlic
- 1 tbsp chilli oil
- 2 tbs XO sauce

##### Borbar
- 1 cup rice
- 1 lbs pork belly cut into 2" cubes
- 1 strip bacon sliced
- 64 oz chicken stock
- 1 tsp ginger finely chopped
- 1 pinch salt
- 2 tsp sesame oil
- 1 oz soy sauce to taste

*Preparation*
1. In a large open pot, combine rice, pork, bacon and stock. Slowly bring to boil.
2. Turn heat down to light simmer.
3. Cover with lid and cook over 2 hours. Occasionally stir and skim to prevent sticking until rice is dissolved and pork is tender.
4. Remove pot from heat and place pork chunks into a separate bowl to cool.
5. Shred pork.
6. Add crab, or razor clams, shredded pork, ginger, salt, pepper, sesame oil, and soy sauce into pot. Adjust flavors as desired.
7. Cook for an additional 10 minutes until crab, or razor clams, are fully cooked.

Serve in bowls and garnish with chilli oil, fried garlic, fresh herbs, and a dollop of XO sauce.
